    <h1>Interface Personas & Storyboarding</h1>
    <h3>The Interface</h3>
    <p>
      The following image displays the microwave in my home and beside it is a
      sketch of its controls with a few notes.
    </p>
    <div class="images">
      <img src="assets/microwave_irl.JPG" width="20%" />
      <img src="assets/microwave_sketch.png" width="40%" />
    </div>
    <p>
      As shown above, the interface provides various ways to use and control the
      microwave. The key components involve a start/pause and a clear/off
      button, along with various other buttons for different modes, such as
      “popcorn” and “defrost”.
    </p>
    <br />
    <h3>Observations</h3>
    <p>After observing 3 people use the microwave, I've noticed:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        Two of the three only use the ‘time cook’ function. The other user also
        used ‘defrost’ and ‘reheat’, but took longer to decide.
      </li>
      <li>
        Majority of microwave usage was between 30 seconds and 3 minutes. There
        were few instances of microwave times greater than 5 minutes.
      </li>
      <li>
        One person double presses the circular wheel to start, the others press
        the circular wheel and then the ‘start’ button. The same person is
        noticeably a lot faster at starting the microwave, while the other two
        seem to struggle a bit with selecting a specific amount of time.
      </li>
      <li>Two users tend to stop the microwave early.</li>
      <li>
        Most of the items microwaved were leftovers: mainly rice and side
        dishes. Also defrosted shrimp, made a bowl of ramen, and made some
        popcorn.
      </li>
    </ul>

    <p>
      Then, I asked my 3 users the following questions with the following
      summarized responses:
    </p>
    <ol>
      <li>Are you in a time crunch?</li>
      There was only one instance were the user was using the microwave with a
      strict time crunch.
      <li>How essential is the food that you're microwaving?</li>
      Most instances were for
      <b>meals</b>
      (lunch and dinner), with one answer describing a quick snack and another
      describing an ingredient in a dessert.
      <li>Is there another device you could use instead?</li>
      Answers involved using the stove and a pot or pan, but two of the three
      noted that it would
      <b>take longer</b>
      and involve more dishes to wash.
      <li>What’s going to happen to the item you put in?</li>
      Most of the answers involved wanting to
      <b>heat up</b>
      some kind of food item.
      <li>Are there any buttons you don’t need?</li>
      Noticed that no one used the ‘convection bake’, ‘convection roast’, or
      ‘combination fast bake’ buttons on the right of the wheel. ‘Micro express’
      was a mystery that came up again. Only one of the users expressed that
      they use multiple different buttons.
    </ol>
    <br />
    <h3>Empathy Maps</h3>
    <p>
      Using the data collected during my observations and interviews, I
      constructed 2 personas with empathy maps that describe what they think,
      feel, say, and do.
    </p>
    <div class="row">
      <div class="images col-md-6">
        <img src="assets/jason_empathy.png" width="100%" />
      </div>
      <div class="col-md-6">
        <p>
          The first persona I constructed was Jason. Jason is the parent of a
          college-aged kid, nearing his 60s. His wife goes to work during the
          day, but since he works from home, he now has to do a lot more
          cooking. He’s definitely more experienced with using more traditional
          means of cooking and heating food as he’s not well-versed in
          navigating the microwave’s interface.
        </p>
        <p>
          He struggles with the microwave interface because of the overwhelming
          number of choices and finds the wheel in the middle confusing to use.
        </p>
        <p>
          Jason represents the older users of the microwave interface and those
          who tend to incorporate the microwave as a part of the cooking
          process, instead of solely relying on it. These users may have more
          varied uses for the microwave, such as defrosting ingredients and
          boiling water.
        </p>
      </div>
    </div>
    <br />
    <div class="row">
      <div class="images col-md-6">
        <img src="assets/jenny_empathy.png" width="100%" />
      </div>
      <div class="col-md-6">
        <p>
          The second persona I constructed was Jenny. Jenny is a college-aged
          student taking classes full-time and involved with quite a few clubs.
          She doesn’t really enjoy cooking.
        </p>
        <p>
          Jenny primarily uses the microwaves to prepare meals quickly, such as
          frozen dumplings from Trader Joe’s. Her main problem with the current
          interface is that she only really ever uses the ‘time cook’ function,
          but it’s quite inconvenient for longer amounts.
        </p>
        <p>
          Jenny represents the younger users that enjoy and are accustomed to
          microwaveable foods. A lot of people, like Jenny, tend to use the
          microwave because they want to be quick and efficient. These types of
          users want to streamline the process and get to their desired result
          as easily as possible.
        </p>
      </div>
    </div>
    <br />

    <h3>Storyboard</h3>
    <p>
      Finally, using Jenny as the main persona, I created the following
      storyboard that provides context and shows how she would interact with the
      interface:
